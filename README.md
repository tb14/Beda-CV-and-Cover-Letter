This is a test to see how Gitkraken works.

Rabea, try and change this file on your computer, then push it to github and I will pull it on to my computer, this should allow us to double chek that everything is working ok.

Making additional changes so that Rabea can see how these changes appear in the GUI.

I only understood the purpose of this now but so now I'm doing it:D

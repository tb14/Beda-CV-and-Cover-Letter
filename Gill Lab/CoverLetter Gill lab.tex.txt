%%%%RESEARCH INTEREST
%%%Directed Genome Evolution: New Tools and Applications 
%Our research falls within the general fields of METABOLIC ENGINEERING, SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY, DIRECTED EVOLUTION, and GENOMICS and is targeted primarily towards the development biorefining processes for the SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF FUELS, COMMODITY CHEMICALS, PHARMACEUTICALS. We are generally focused on the development of new i) tools for STRAIN ENGINEERING (i.e. genome engineering), ii) methods for efficiently DETERMINING the GENETIC BASIS of so engineered strains (i.e. functional genomics), and iii) frameworks for rationalizing RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. Our specific projects include:

%• Creation, development, and demonstration of novel GENOME-ENGINEERING TOOLS.
%• Metabolic engineering for SUSTAINABLE and FUNGIBLE BIO-DIESEL
%• Metabolic engineering for sustainable and fungible BIO-GASOLINE production
%• Creation, development, and demonstration of new approaches for ANTIMICROBIAL DISCOVERY
%• Genome-engineering to IMPROVE CELLULOSIC biofuels production

%Our research is supported through a number of sources including current or previous grants from the NSF, NIH, DOE, State of Colorado, University of Colorado, Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Agilent, Shell, Dupont, and Opx Bioproducts.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%Involved here: 
%%%%Design and engineering of synthetic control architectures

%%advance biological engineering to a new level of throughput and complexity. Guided by computer-aided design platforms, this research will develop new finely tuned microbial strains containing orthogonal regulatory networks. The redesigned strains will be tailored to grow on a variety of feedstocks, tolerate toxic metabolites and other stresses, and produce valuable molecules. Building on technologies and knowledge developed with prior DOE funding from the Biosystems Design program, the project will further develop the necessary technical and computational infrastructure to achieve its goals, initially working with Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and later transferring the technologies to other non-model bacteria and yeast species.

With the hands-on practice in using recombineering techniques that I aquired while working for James Sawitzke in the Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility of Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences (EMBL) in Rome, I am ready to engineer new strains in your lab. My understanding of CRISPR/Cas systems in general and the Synechocystis CRISPR/Cas system in particular enable me to develop and implement CRISPR/Cas based genetic engineering tools. The team spirit and interpersonal skills I developed during the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition, 
and the initiative and ability to adapt to new situations I have displayed while working for EMBL ensure that I can quickly transition to your lab and begin making contributions from day one.\par\vspace*{3mm}

%My fist direct interaction with a recombination technology was during the iGEM competition when we designed and cloned our genetic constructs using Gibson Assembly. During this time one of our supervisors also worked on a new technology, which follows the same principle of Gibson Assembly but takes advantage of the cells inherent recombineering system---he called it AQUA (advanced quick assembly) cloning. 
During my M.Sc. I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 students to develop a low-cost, multiplexed and label-free diagnostic tool %as part of the Univerisity of Freiburg's team 
in the iGEM competition.
Within eight months of wet lab we produced high-value {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, presenting our findings on our 
{\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Home_Intro}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at iGEM's international conference at MIT, where we were awarded a Gold medal and nominated for Best Health and Medicine Project, Best Innovation in Medicine and Best Wiki.
Throughout iGEM we successfully ran our own lab independently, including ordering reagents, communicating with companies and funding agencies, making and sterilizing media and keeping the lab and our data organized. 
%This experience demonstrates my strong work ethic, team-player attitude and ability to distill the essentials from scientific findings for my team and a wider audience.
		%If it demonstrates it there's no need of mentioning that
\par\vspace*{3mm}

For my M.Sc. thesis I explored the use of the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in metabolic engineering by modifying the Cas proteins of one of its CRISPR loci via homologous recombination and providing an artificial crRNA via conjugation.
I used Gibson Assembly and \textit{in vivo} cloning to design and generate the genetic constructs, produced recombinant proteins in \textit{E. coli}, extracted and analyzed RNA \textit{in vitro} and from Synechocystis cultures and eventually  {\href{https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/vmAQ3vjYGdZIZpIKQTIT/full}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{published}}}}} on the biochemical characterization of the Synechocystis crRNA maturation endonuclease Cas6-1.
\par\vspace*{3mm}
After my M.Sc. I began working for James Sawitzke in EMBL's Genetic Engineering Facility where I constructed various genetic constructs by recombining ssDNA or dsDNA on a plasmid or BAC.
%Write exactly what kind of recombinnering projects I did, on plasmid/BAC, read up on publications and on their website (https://redrecombineering.ncifcrf.gov/protocols/)
Soon after I started, the facility evolved into being the Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility, so I quickly adapted and got engaged in implementing new protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. 			
Initially our two person team only provided recombinant AAV, but as my skills progressed, our portfolio has expanded to include recombinant lentivirus and we are in the process of adding HSV.
I addition to the laboratory work, I have taken the initiative to extend the facility's database and automate calculations for protocols using Excel and Filemaker, helping streamline the lab and more consistently produce and record valuable data. 
Additionally, I am continually applying techniques I learned from a professional development course on project management for scientists across more than 12 projects to deliver high quality final products in a timely fashion to our partners.\par\vspace*{3mm}

Although EMBL offered extensive experience in the lab and provided room for growth, the research focus is simply not after my own heart and I would rather like to use my knowledge in recombineering and CRISPR/Cas systems towards developing microorganisms for the production of commodity chemicals or biofuels.
If you agree, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential position and my contributions in more detail. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 			THOMAS GENERAL NOTES 			%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Thomas: I love the changes! The additional detail is great!
%
% Thomas: Also, it's easier for me to see when you reply to my comments on a new, indented line
%				Thomas: Like this!
%
% Thomas: Do you want your address stuff to be at the bottom of every page or just the first one?		
%			Rabea: Maybe every page is better
%
%
% Thomas: I think the summary paragraph in the beginning is equivalent to a combo of the first and last paragraph in the cover letter: 1) This is why you want me + This is why I want you (in that order of importance). 
%			I changed yours, let me know what you think.		
%			Rabea: I cut it down to make it a reasonable length, what do you think?
%
% Summary paragraph: 4-5 easily digestible (readable) sentences.
%1) I know what you're working on and here's roughly why I could help; 
%2) Here are some hard skills I have that you would find useful; 
%3) Here are some soft skills I could use anywhere that you would find useful; 
%4) I am really passionate about what you do and bring a great attitude and work ethic 
%5) You all are my dream job, please please please take me (hysterical sobbing)!

%
\begin{spacing}{1.2}
\color{dark-gray}{
Photosynthetic organisms will play a vital role in transitioning towards a sustainable economy and as a dedicated researcher with a strong practical and theoretical background, I am well equipped to help make this a reality. 
%               maybe something like a specific technique (assays?)), and below you list all the times you did X and in the cover letter you write ``While working on my thesis I honed my ability in ``assays'', a skill I further improved while at EMBL and one which I                         %		     could employ successfully at NREL (or something along those lines)
During my theses and time at Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences (EMBL) I have honed my skills in genetically engineering  \textit{E. coli} as well as algae and cyanobacteria.%
%  work on inter-sentence flow
Through these experiences and my time competing in iGEM, I have  developed an ability to function both independently and as part of an interdisciplinary team. %, an eye for details and the analytical skills necessary to consult relevant literature to establish new protocols. %
% a few soft skills you think they might want to hear about. We should also be careful about talking about things you never mention again. This is just the intor for what you explain later below and in your cover 				letter
% Thomas: might also want to squeeze in your computer skills? Dunno.
All this combined with a strong work ethic and a passion for bioenergy make me an excellent candidate for the National Bioenergy Center.
%and I believe working on your cutting edge research would bring me closer to my goals of making bioenergy a reliable and affordable alternative to fossil fuels.

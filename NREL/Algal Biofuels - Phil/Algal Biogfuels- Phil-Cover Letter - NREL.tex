%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   RABEA READ ME!!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% I am changing a few things just to clean it up. 
% Since we will mostly be working in the latex files from now on, most of our comments should be here too. 
% I will be moving towards only having the latex files in the github repository.
% In order to differentiate between old comments, and between your comments and mine, I will begin all my comments particular to this document with `Thomas:' (unless it appears in `THOMAS GENERAL NOTES SECTION')
% If you answer one of my comments with your own, please INDENT (just hit tab once or twice) and start with `Rabea:'  . . . This should make it easier to read these, thank you for your patience.
%
%
% ALSO: Please don't be angry, I made a lot of suggestions and not too many corrections. All in all I think your other cover letters were better at conveying why you would be a good fit. Perhaps we can talk over the phone about this soon? Love you!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 		CHECKLIST		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% 		Did you:
%				1) Check for the correct date?
%				2) Check that the recipeient's name and address were correct?
%				3) Copy into Word for spelling errors?
%				4) Use a word counter online to check for overused language?

I am fed up with being a contributor or at least a bystander in the destruction of our livelihood the environment---I want to be part of the solution and have an abiding desire to contribute to the National Bioenergy Center's efforts to find sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. %
% Thomas: Same comment as in the `Methane' letter: it grabs their attention, but I would try and bend it more towards how you can help them. Since this is arguably one of the most important sentences in the letter, i will think more on it and focus more on it over the weekend
Having focused on algae and cyanobacteria during my B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses, having participated in the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and having worked for Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences in Rome, I bring the neccessary background knowledge and the enthusiasm, strong work ethic and eagerness to learn to make up for any deficiency.%
% Thomas: 
\par\vspace*{1mm}

During my bachelor thesis I gained insight into the cultivation of \textit{N. oceanica} and \textit{P. tricornutum} and during my master thesis I successfully cultivated and processed Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}}. 
These experiences have left me well prepared to work preparing and cultivating both algae and cyanobacteria. 
In addition, the wide array of lectures and courses I took in biochemistry, translational biology and microbiology has  left me with a solid foundation to learn and develop new procedures and protocols in the lab. 
As an example, during a reorganization of my current lab, I consulted relevant literature to establish standard protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. 
Due to the reshaping I also started working in a BSL2 environment and am aware of the importance of stringently following safety guidelines and maintaining a safe working environment. 
Our facility currently only consists of my supervisor and me, meaning I not only produce high-quality viral vectors and genetic constructs independently, but also maintain a functional laboratory and took the initiative to improve the facility's database (FileMaker)---leaving me with excellent organizational skills I will invest to ensure accurate data recording and storage at the NBC.  
I have also attended a professional course on presenting with impact and project management for scientists and am able to apply these techniques to balance multiple projects---currently more than 12 at once---while managing my time to deliver final products as quickly as possible.  \par%\vspace*{1mm}

For the iGEM competition I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 highly motivated students.
Within a month we agreed on an influential topic, and after only eight months of wet lab we produced high-value  {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, finally presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at an international conference. 
This experience has not only left me with a strong work ethic, but also with the ability to efficiently identify the essentials from scientific findings and to present these in a comprehensive way to my team and a wider audience. 
During this time we successfully ran our own lab independently, including ordering reagents, communicating with companies and funding agencies for financial or material aid, making and sterilizing media and keeping the lab and our data organized. \par

Given my skill set I believe I could make valuable contributions to NBC's team and it would be an honor to contribute to your research into algal biofuels. 
If you agree, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential position and my contributions in more detail. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

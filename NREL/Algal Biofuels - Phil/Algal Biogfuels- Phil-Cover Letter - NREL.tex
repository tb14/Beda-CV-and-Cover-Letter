%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   RABEA READ ME!!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% I am changing a few things just to clean it up. 
% Since we will mostly be working in the latex files from now on, most of our comments should be here too. 
% I will be moving towards only having the latex files in the github repository.
% In order to differentiate between old comments, and between your comments and mine, I will begin all my comments particular to this document with `Thomas:' (unless it appears in `THOMAS GENERAL NOTES SECTION')
% If you answer one of my comments with your own, please INDENT (just hit tab once or twice) and start with `Rabea:'  . . . This should make it easier to read these, thank you for your patience.
%
%
% ALSO: Please don't be angry, I made a lot of suggestions and not too many corrections. All in all I think your other cover letters were better at conveying why you would be a good fit. Perhaps we can talk over the phone about this soon? Love you!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 		CHECKLIST		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTES FOR CONTEXT OF LETTER, INFO ON ADDRESSEE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% HEY! This is what I found under Philip Pleikos on this page: https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/algal-biofuels.html =>

%Establishing Testbeds
%
%As a member of the Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership led by Arizona State University, we are focusing on establishing a sustainable network of regional testbeds to gather and share information within the algal research and development community, facilitate innovation, and accelerate growth of the algal biofuels and bioproducts industry. Our goals are to increase stakeholder access to high-quality, outdoor cultivation and laboratory facilities; support DOE's techno-economic, sustainability, and resource modeling activities; close critical knowledge gaps; and inform analyses of the state of technology for producing algal biofuels and bioproducts.
%
%Contact: Philip Pienkos

% It sounds like if you want to really reach him, you should tailor some of the message around this: ``establishing a sustainable network of regional test beds'' to facilitate others' research and accelerate the industry



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 			THOMAS GENERAL NOTES 			%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Have you read anything they've published? Anything interesting? Anything you would want to work on? That may be a good segue. Any techniques they use a lot in which you are skilled.

% Ok, slowly but surely a general `outline' is starting to take shape in my mind (this is your cover letter so it's ultimately up to you, but . . .): 
%		1) Intro, we've been over how to do these
%		2) Hard science skills specific to EMBL + thesis (your work with algae and cyanobacteria in particular)
%		3) Soft science skills (maintaining a lab, presentation, etc.) + iGEM hard skills
%		4) Closing, you can do these well

% As I can't help with the #2 I'll focus on the #3 and #4

% It might also make more sense to squeeze all the science stuff into the 2nd paragraph and all the soft skills into the third paragraph

% In general I would say the main issue you could focus on writing-wise is flow. They're seeing this all for the first time, so it's important that the issues proceed logically from one another and they will be impressed if it is not just a bunch of different ideas bunched together (this is very hard to do and I am aware of that)

% WARNING- You should be aware, these people work both work for the U.S. government and work on this stuff everyday, this means: 
%		1) They cannot criticize the government and probably are loathe to criticize anyone. That means you can't insult fossil fuel companies and you can't insult governments.
%		2) They aren't nearly as impressed by your committment to climate change (not on paper at least) as other places might be. For them, having worked on theories of climate change for so long, climate change is still a very `textbook' kind of problem to 					solve, not some major catastrophe. I mean, they think it's bad too, it's just most people don't work on these topics day-in-and-day-out so they are not fatigued by it all the time. These people are ALWAYS working on climate change.

%First option: 
%Living as a German in Italy has taught me a lot about frustration and still not giving up---and I will not give up the well-being of our environment and will invest my hands-on laboratory experience, strong work ethic and deep passion for nature to find sustainable alternatives to fossil energy. 
%		Thomas: I would not go with this one, Italy = frustrating is an inside joke but not very professional.
%Second option: 
% In Italy I have encountered a lot of people who have given up on the planet, the politics and changing anything in general. %
% But there are still some ready to fight---I am one of them and will invest my hands-on laboratory experience, strong work ethic and deep passion for nature to find sustainable alternatives to fossil energy. %
%		Thomas: So I like the general idea behind this: things are shit and a lot of people are giving up but I want to do something about it. I really like everything after the ``---''. Let's work on changing the first portion, making it less Italy specific, and more 		 				 professional and also a little less `egocentric' (in the sense that `they have given up, but I'm better than that', it's not that strong but just to be safe we should tone it down a bit) 
%				Maybe: 
Although the overwhelming nature of climate change lends itself to despondency, I am determined to do my part by investing my hands-on laboratory experience, strong work ethic and deep passion for nature to find affordable, practical alternatives to fossil energy in order to build a sustainable future.
% It would be an honor to do so at NREL's Bioenergy Center.
Given the cutting edge research that takes place at NREL's Bioenergy Center, it would be an honor to participate in your project to \emph{\textbf{save the planet}} % 
%		Thomas: what exactly does it say on their website that their goal is? Might be a good place to insert that. (see above in ``notes for context...'')
%				Which of the four groups here would you best fit in: https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/research.html  ?
%				If you focus on that maybe you can further refine your message? Let me know which one you think you'd be in (I believe bioenergetics or biochemical processes) and I can help
% After a B.Sc. in Biology and participation in the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition, I received a M.Sc. in Biology before starting to work with Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences, EMBL, in Rome. %
%%	Rabea: I think this sentence sounds boring and doesn't tell them anything useful
%				Thomas: I agree, how can we make this better? Perhaps if we focus on some of the specific hard or soft skills you have? And then below we can mention where you used them? For instance if you read that he uses process `x' a lot in his papers 							and you happen to use that process on a daily basis at EMBL then we could mention that? (I can read through his papers and look for methods they use (should be in abstract no?)
Combining my experience in working with algae and cyanobacteria with the team spirit I aquired during iGEM and the adaptive capacity I showed at EMBL make me a perfect fit for NREL's Bioenergy Center.\par\vspace*{1mm} %
%		Rabea: Better?
%				Thomas: I think so, yes. This all has to flow well so we will likely move this sentence around and change a few grammar things but that can wait until we have a more final draft, for now it looks good! 



%For my theses {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}} I manipulated and analyzed algae (\textit{P. tricornutum}, \textit{N. ocecanica}) and cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803). 
%More specifically, I used different transformation methods, analyzed their protein and RNA expression and explored the endogenous Synechocystis CRISPR-Cas system for appplication in metabolic engineering. 
% 		Thomas: I would combine these rather than have the ``more specifically'' part-
% 				Also, if you're only refering to your M.Sc. (which I'm guessing since you have the publication) it's just thesis
For my thesis {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}} I used various transformation methods to analyze the proteins and RNA expression of algae (\textit{P. tricornutum}, \textit{N. ocecanica}) and cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803) and explored the endogenous Synechocystis CRISPR-Cas system for appplication in metabolic engineering.
%		Thomas: also, this guy works with algae and cyanobacteria, YOU HAVE WORKED WITH ALGAE AND CYANOBACTERIA. I would spend a lot more time talking about how your thesis prepares you to work in his lab and less time talking about BLS2							Did you learn any useful techniques? Spend any time outside your thesis with cyanobacteria? Here's where you can talk about it!
The wide array of lectures and courses I took in biochemistry, translational biology and microbiology has left me with a solid foundation to learn and develop new procedures and protocols in the lab. %
% 		Thomas: This is fine, but I think we need to change the `flow' of this paragraph. Right now you have 1) Really specific experience in exactly his field and then in the next sentence 2) I've had a lot of lectures in a much broader category. The point you make 					about being able to adapt well is important, I would just spend another sentence or two on algae + cyanobacteria before moving onto your ability to learn new stuff.
As an example, during a reorganization of my current lab, I consulted relevant literature to establish standard protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. %
%		Thomas: Again, good stuff, let's just get the order and flow down better
% Due to the reshaping I also started working in a BSL2 environment and am aware of the importance of stringently following safety guidelines and maintaining a safe working environment. 
%		Thomas: I think this is not nearly as important in this situation as it was in previous applications so I would drop it to make more room for other stuff
Our facility currently only consists of my supervisor and me, meaning I not only produce high-quality viral vectors and genetic constructs independently, but also maintain a functional laboratory and took the initiative to improve the facility's database (FileMaker)---leaving me with excellent organizational skills I will invest to ensure accurate data recording and storage at the NBC.
%		Thomas: So with respect to my second set of `THOMAS NOTES' I would change this to focus only on the high-quality viral vectors (and the fact that you taught yourself new protocols) and mention the database and functional lab stuff in the next paragraph  
%I have also attended a professional course on presenting with impact and project management for scientists and am able to apply these techniques to balance multiple projects---currently more than 12 at once---while managing my time to deliver final products as quickly as possible.  \par%\vspace*{1mm}
%		Thomas: I would move this to the next paragraph

% For the iGEM competition I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 highly motivated students.
%		Thomas: Since you won't be mentioning the B.Sc. > M.Sc. > iGEM > EMBL work flow here I would add just a bit to `set the stage'
While completing my M.Sc. I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 students to develop a \textbf{\emph{your project in a few words}} as part of the Univerisity of Freiburg's iGEM competition submission.
% Within a month we agreed on an influential topic, and after only eight months of wet lab we produced high-value  {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, finally presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at an international conference.
%		Thomas: Just because the topic is mentioned in the first sentence now
After only eight months of wet lab we produced high-value  {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, finally presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at an international conference, where we won \textbf{\emph{medals you won}}.
This experience has not only left me with a strong work ethic, but also with the ability to efficiently identify the essentials from scientific findings and to present these in a comprehensive way to my team and a wider audience. %
%		Thomas: Depending on how you want to structure this, the first two sentences of this paragraph could be moved to the 2nd paragraph and these last two could stay here.
During this time we \colorbox{green}{also} successfully ran our own lab independently, including ordering reagents, communicating with companies and funding agencies for financial or material aid, making and sterilizing media and keeping the lab and our data organized. \par%

Given my skill set I believe I could make valuable contributions to \sout{NBC's team} \colorbox{green}{the National Biofuel Center's team} and it would be an honor to contribute to your research into algal biofuels. 
If you agree, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential position and my contributions in more detail. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

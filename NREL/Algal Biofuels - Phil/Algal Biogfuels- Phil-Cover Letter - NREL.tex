%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTES FOR CONTEXT OF LETTER, INFO ON ADDRESSEE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% HEY! This is what I found under Philip Pleikos on this page: https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/algal-biofuels.html =>

%Establishing Testbeds
%
%As a member of the Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership led by Arizona State University, we are focusing on establishing a sustainable network of regional testbeds to gather and share information within the algal research and development community, facilitate innovation, and accelerate growth of the algal biofuels and bioproducts industry. Our goals are to increase stakeholder access to high-quality, outdoor cultivation and laboratory facilities; support DOE's techno-economic, sustainability, and resource modeling activities; close critical knowledge gaps; and inform analyses of the state of technology for producing algal biofuels and bioproducts.
%
%Contact: Philip Pienkos
%
%There is also this:
%Algal Biomass Conversion
%
%NREL is developing novel process options to reduce the cost of algal biofuel production through more complete utilization of algal biomass. We have developed a low-cost, low-energy method to deconstruct algal biomass to allow for recovery and upgrading of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins to biofuels and bioproducts.

%Contact: Philip Pienkos

% It sounds like if you want to really reach him, you should tailor some of the message around this: ``establishing a sustainable network of regional test beds'' to facilitate others' research and accelerate the industry



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 			THOMAS GENERAL NOTES 			%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% RABEA: Much better! Really, you did a great job of mentioning the specifics of your work! I am very impressed (not bullshitting you)

% I think the main issue now is getting things to make sense `chronologically'. I know, I know: I was the one who wanted to change the outline to a hard-skill/soft-skill split. But I think with some work we can maintain that divide AND make it clear to them the order of your positions (if not, then we can get close and the CV will clear up the rest)

% Have you read anything they've published? Anything interesting? Anything you would want to work on? That may be a good segue. Any techniques they use a lot in which you are skilled.

% Green highlighting is just to show you where I've added stuff (and don't want to comment out whole lines)

% Do you think it would be safe to mention ``Microbial Development and Metabolic Engineering''? I think it would show that you had done your research on them

% ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS keep this in mind when writing this: ``NREL advances the science and engineering of energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, and renewable power technologies and provides the knowledge to integrate and optimize energy systems.'' This is the language you should try to adopt when possible and especially when talking about why you want to work for them

This will not be the best piece of literature you will ever read---but I can assure you that I will take good care of your microorganisms and provide high-quality and reliable experimental data at the end of the day. %
And that is what counts, right? %
% Thomas: I'll be honest, while I agree that my language was not your style, I would not send this. It would almost be better to start with the next sentence (with some adaptation). I think it's best not to bring up any shortcomings you have in the first sentence, but let's see what my mom has to say.
Sharing your passion for renewables, I will whole-heartedly invest my hands-on laboratory experience, strong work ethic and analytical thinking to find affordable, practical alternatives to fossil \sout{energy} \colorbox{green}{fuels}, to facilitate others' research and accelerate the industry.
% Thomas: So I really like this sentence, the last part (starting with `to facilitate...') I would still work on . . . maybe `and facilitate NBC researchers in their quest to accelerate the biofuels industry'?
Combining my experience in microbial development and metabolic engineering in algae, cyanobacteria and \textit{E. coli} with the team spirit I aquired during the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and the adaptive capacity I showed at Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences make me a perfect fit for NREL's Bioenergy Center.
% Thomas: So I like this sentence a lot, but I think some rearrangement would help benefit it- `My experience in microbial development and metabolic engineering in algae, cyanobacteria and \textit{E. coli} combined with the team spirit and interpersonal skills I developed during  the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition make me a perfect fit for NREL's Bioenergy Center. Furthermore, the initiative and ability to adapt to new situations I have displayed while working at Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences ensure that I will eaasily be able to transition to your lab and begin supporting NBC researchers from day 1.' (or something similar?)
Given the cutting edge research that takes place at your institute, it would be an honor to participate in your mission to transform energy through science.%
% Thomas: I would only mimic their language, not directly copy it, and in this particular sentence I would not use their language at all. Here, if ever is the chance to talk about you. The previous sentences were all about why they wanted you, now you should say why you want them, here I would say be yourself and say why you really want to help, in your words.
\par\vspace*{1mm}

My journey with photosynthetic organisms started during my B.Sc. thesis when I got my hands on the diatom \textit{P. tricornutum} in which I expressed a recombinant antibody to characterize intracellular protein transport. % Thomas: good
Unfortunately this data got lost in the depths of academics and never got published, a fact that I learned to improve in my M.Sc. {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}}. % 
% Thomas: Did not like this at first but when I saw the second half I think it was good (you mention you learned to improve this (shows growth and highlights your publication)). I would still change how you word the first part but we can work on that later after I've had time to think
For this project I altered the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome via homologous recombination and transformed a plasmid via conjugation to explore whether we \sout{can}\colorbox{green}{could} use the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system in metabolic engineering. 
In the process I became familiar with extracting and analyzing RNA \textit{in vitro} and from Synechocystis cultures, documenting pigment content via photometric measurements and producing genetic constructs and recombinant proteins in \textit{E. coli}. 
% Thomas: These two are great in my opinion (imo)
Again, unfortunately I had to move on before we could fully optimize the whole process. %
%Thomas: so unlike the first time you did this, this sentence is not nearly as redeeming. You didn't really explain what went wrong nor did you show that you've grown beyond that mistake, if possible I would drop this.
Fortunately my studies prepared me well for what was about to come. %
% Thomas: so I think this is a bit vague, you could mention a few of your courses to make it specific, and, if possible, tie them to specific tasks you've performed at EMBL or elsewhere (but that is a really tough thing to do, I know)
As I started my new postition at the Genetic Engineering Facility\colorbox{green}{, which consists of only my advisor and myself,} it evolved into \sout{a} \colorbox{green}{the} Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility \sout{and}\colorbox{green}{where} I established new standard protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. For now we provide recombinant AAV and Lentivirus but are in the process of adding recombinant HSV to the facility's portfolio.\par

While completing my M.Sc. I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 students to develop a low-cost, multiplexed and label-free diagnostic tool as part of the Univerisity of Freiburg's team in the iGEM competition
\sout{submission}.
After only eight months of wet lab we produced high-value  {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, finally presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at \sout{an}\colorbox{green}{iGEM's} international conference \colorbox{green}{at MIT}, where we won a Gold medal and were nominated for Best Health and Medicine Project, Best Innovation in Medicine and Best Wiki.
This experience has not only left me with a strong work ethic, but also with the ability to efficiently identify the essentials from scientific findings and to present these in a comprehensive way to my team and a wider audience.%
% Thomas: WOW! Really like this!
During this time we also successfully ran our own lab independently, including ordering reagents, communicating with companies and funding agencies for financial or material aid, making and sterilizing media and keeping the lab and our data organized. 
In my current position I expanded on these skills and also took the initiative to improve the facility's database (FileMaker). %
% Thomas: So I'm conflicted about this sentece. On the one hand it's short which helps break up the larger sentences on either side. On the other hand it doesn't say too much. Could you maybe mention other softwarre you use here'? Geneious or whatever?
In addition, I have attended a professional course on project management for scientists and am currently applying these techniques to balance more than 12  projects at once and delivering final products as quickly as possible.
\par

Given my skill set I believe I could make valuable contributions at the National Bioenergy Center and it would be an honor to contribute to your research into algal biofuels. 
If you agree, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential position and my contributions in more detail. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

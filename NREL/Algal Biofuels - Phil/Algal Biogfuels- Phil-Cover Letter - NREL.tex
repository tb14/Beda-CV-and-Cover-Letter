%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTES FOR CONTEXT OF LETTER, INFO ON ADDRESSEE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% HEY! This is what I found under Philip Pleikos on this page: https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/algal-biofuels.html =>

%Establishing Testbeds
%
%As a member of the Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership led by Arizona State University, we are focusing on establishing a sustainable network of regional testbeds to gather and share information within the algal research and development community, facilitate innovation, and accelerate growth of the algal biofuels and bioproducts industry. Our goals are to increase stakeholder access to high-quality, outdoor cultivation and laboratory facilities; support DOE's techno-economic, sustainability, and resource modeling activities; close critical knowledge gaps; and inform analyses of the state of technology for producing algal biofuels and bioproducts.
%
%Contact: Philip Pienkos
%
%There is also this:
%Algal Biomass Conversion
%
%NREL is developing novel process options to reduce the cost of algal biofuel production through more complete utilization of algal biomass. We have developed a low-cost, low-energy method to deconstruct algal biomass to allow for recovery and upgrading of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins to biofuels and bioproducts.
%
%Contact: Philip Pienkos
%
% It sounds like if you want to really reach him, you should tailor some of the message around this: ``establishing a sustainable network of regional test beds'' to facilitate others' research and accelerate the industry



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 			THOMAS GENERAL NOTES 			%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% RABEA: Much better! Really, you did a great job of mentioning the specifics of your work! I am very impressed (not bullshitting you)
		%Rabea: Wow something good for a change :P, just kidding you said good stuff before already :)

%make sense `CHRONOLOGICALLY'. 


% Do you think it would be safe to mention ``Microbial Development and Metabolic Engineering''?
			%Rabea: It's also not that they brandmarked that term eh?

% ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS keep this in mind when writing this: ``NREL advances the science and engineering of energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, and renewable power technologies and provides the knowledge to integrate and optimize energy systems.'' This is the language you should try to adopt when possible and especially when talking about why you want to work for them

%Working on my theses felt like I was in the right place---working with passion on something I considered worthwhile. % not my style but ok
%Now, working at an institute focused on Neurobiology and Epigenetics I still enjoy the nature of my job---but the passion is gone. % not my style but ok
%Investing my hands-on laboratory experience, strong work ethic and analytical thinking at the National Bioenergy Center to find affordable, practical alternatives to fossil fuels would bring it back. % not my style AND NOT OK
%		Thomas: You are talking about your passions but that doesn't come through, we need to spice it up more if you are going for the `familiar' (as in you speak a bit as if he might be your friend) approach. Perhaps the below:
With my strong background in microbiology, specifically with photosynthetic organisms, and a passion for renewable energy, I believe I could make a strong contribution to your lab and to algal research. 
My hands-on laboratory experience from my B.Sc., M.Sc. and current position with Europe's flagship laboratory for life sciences (EMBL) combined with a strong work ethic and analytical thinking would allow me to facilitate NBC's goal of accelerating the deployment and adoption of biofuels.
Likewise, my specific experience in microbial development and metabolic engineering in algae, cyanobacteria and \textit{E. coli} combined with the interpersonal skills I developed during the iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machine) competition would also make me an excellent fit for your lab and ensure I could begin making contributions from the first day. 
%Furthermore, the initiative an, team attituded ability to adapt to new situations I have displayed while working at Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences ensure that I will easily be able to transition to your lab and begin supporting NBC researchers from day 1.
% Given the focus of your cutting edge research, it would be a dream come true if I was given the chance to work for you.
%			%Rabea: too much:P? It rhyyyyymes! But probably too much, I can rephrase
%					Thomas: This is both too much and too little- the ending has a big premise (NREL would be a dream come true) but that doesn't come out very clearly above, Furthermore they should be reading about why you would be a dream come true to them, I will try moving some of this to the last paragraph where it might be more appropriate
\par\vspace*{1mm}

My journey with photosynthetic organisms started during my B.Sc. thesis when I got my hands on the diatom \textit{P. tricornutum} in which I expressed a recombinant antibody to characterize intracellular protein transport. 
% Unfortunately this data got lost in the depths of academics and never got published, a fact that I learned to improve in my M.Sc. {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}}. % 
% 		Thomas: I would drop this whole `unfortunately' thing. Better to just mention the B.Sc. work, talk about how you took those hard skills and brought them to your M.Sc., point to the publication and move on. Perhaps like so?:
Later, during my M.Sc. thesis I was able to apply the research skills and microbiology techniques I learned during my B.Sc. to alter the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome via homologous recombination and transformed a plasmid via conjugation to explore whether we could use the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system in metabolic engineering {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29517395}{\textcolor{blue}{{\textit{(Publication)}}}}}. 
%For this project I altered the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome via homologous recombination and transformed a plasmid via conjugation to explore whether we could use the endogenous CRISPR-Cas system in metabolic engineering. 
In the process I became familiar with extracting and analyzing RNA \textit{in vitro} and from Synechocystis cultures, documenting pigment content via photometric measurements and producing genetic constructs and recombinant proteins in \textit{E. coli}. 
% Unfortunately I did not have time to fully optimize the process as I got a position offered at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Rome.%
% 		Thomas: Again, I would drop the Unfortunately part and transition quickly to EMBL
Once I finished with my M.Sc. I began working in EMBL's Genetic Engineering Facility, later evolving into the Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility, where I established new standard protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. 
% As I started at the Genetic Engineering Facility, which consists of only my advisor and myself, it evolved into the Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility where I established new standard protocols for the production and quantification of viral vector tools in mammalian cell culture. 
% For now we provide recombinant AAV and Lentivirus but are in the process of adding recombinant HSV to the facility's portfolio.\par
% 		Thomas: I would change this to something like: 
When my position began, our two person team only provided recombinant AAV and Lentivirus, but as my skills progressed, the scope of my and the lab's portfolio has expanded to include recombinant HSV.\par
% 				This makes it sound more like you have grown at the position and they have trusted you with more rather than, ``what's Rabea doin'?'' ``Who cares, let's start making HSV bullshyat, ya heard?''

While completing my M.Sc. I participated in an interdisciplinary team of 20 students to develop a low-cost, multiplexed and label-free diagnostic tool as part of the Univerisity of Freiburg's team in the iGEM competition.
% After only eight months of wet lab we produced high-value  {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, finally presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at iGEM's international conference at MIT, where we won a Gold medal and were nominated for Best Health and Medicine Project, Best Innovation in Medicine and Best Wiki.
%		Thomas: my mom made a good point about avoiding the `after only eight months' and `finally' (it sounds unprofessional
%					Also- we won => were awarded, see below
Within eight months of wet lab we produced high-value {\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803867}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{data}}}}, presenting our team's findings on our {\href{http://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg}{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{website}}}} and at iGEM's international conference at MIT, where we were awarded a Gold medal and nominated for Best Health and Medicine Project, Best Innovation in Medicine and Best Wiki.
%This experience has not only left me with a strong work ethic, but also with the ability to efficiently identify the essentials from scientific findings and to present these in a comprehensive way to my team and a wider audience.%
% 		Thomas: maybe get rid of the `not only' (try and drop the negative) (My experience has taught me I have a strong work ethic and can efficiently, see below)
This experience has taught me that I have a strong work ethic am able to efficiently identify the essentials from scientific findings and to present these in a comprehensive way to my team and a wider audience.
During this time we also successfully ran our own lab independently, including ordering reagents, communicating with companies and funding agencies for financial or material aid, making and sterilizing media and keeping the lab and our data organized. 
%In my current position I expanded on these skills and took the initiative to extend the facility's database (FileMaker) and automize calculations for protocols in Excel and FileMaker. %
% 		Thomas: maybe rearrange to something a bit like the below?
In my position with EMBL I have expanded on these skills and taken the initiative to extend the facility's database and automize calculations for protocols using Excel and Filemaker, helping streamline the lab and more consistently produce and record valuable data.
%In addition, I have attended a professional course on project management for scientists and am currently applying these techniques to balance more than 12  projects at once and delivering final products as quickly as possible.%
% 		Thomas: what do you think of this:
Additionally, I am continually applying techniques I learned from a professional development course on project management for scientists across more than 12 projects to deliver high quality final products in a timel fashion to our partners.
\par

Although my work on my theses and with EMBL granted me extensive experience in the lab and provided for a fascinating challenge, they still lacked a chance to fully enage my talents in a field about which I was genuinely passionate.
Your lab offers the opportunity both to continue my natural development as a microbiologist and help bring a sustainable and affordable alternative to fossil fuels to fruition. 
Given my skill set I believe I could make valuable contributions at the National Bioenergy Center and it would be an honor to contribute to your research into algal biofuels. 
If you agree, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential position and my contributions in more detail. 
Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.

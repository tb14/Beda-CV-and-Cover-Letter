\section{Their focus}
water-energy nexus and energy  and resource recovery during waste treatment processes\\
goal of expanding environmental engineering from pollution clean-up to sustainable development of energy and  environmental systems\\
microbial and electrochemical systems to directly convert biodegradable materials, such as wastewater, biomass, and municipal solid waste into energy, fuels,  materials, chemicals and other value-added products\\
molecular microbiology, electrochemistry, and system engineering tools to understand the fundamental determinant  factors of those systems so as to enhance design, operation, and monitoring in concert with traditional approaches\\

\section{First draft email}

I have never done anything with microbial fuel cells or anything like that so I am not sure how equipped I am, but maybe still worth a try?

Dear Dr. Ren,\par\vspace{5mm}
 

After a friend, Oliver Miltenberger, mentioned your work, I visited your homepage and found your work very appealing. Given my hands-on experience in molecular microbiology, I hope to make a contribution to bringing environmental engineering to the next stage. Please find attached my CV with a summary of my research interests and accomplishments.\par\vspace{5mm}


As a brief background: For my B.Sc. thesis in Biology at the University of Marburg, Germany, I worked with \textit{P. tricornutum} and \textit{N. oceanica} before continuing to study Synechocystis for my M.Sc. thesis in Biology at the University of Freiburg, Germany. During my M.Sc. I also participated in a team to develop an affordable diagnostic tool for the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. After my M.Sc. I joined Europe's flagship laboratory for the life sciences (EMBL) in Rome, Italy, where I work as a Technical Officer in the Genetic and Viral Engineering Facility.\par\vspace{5mm}


Thank you very much for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you soon and will be following up next week to see if you have any questions concerning my qualifications.\par\vspace{5mm}
 

Sincerely,\par\vspace{5mm}

Rabea Jesser
